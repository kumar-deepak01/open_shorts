"""What an OAuth-issued token may reach.

OAuth tokens are ordinary ``osk_`` API keys (cloud/mcp_oauth.py). The consent
screen asks for one thing, the MCP connection, so the key it mints carries
exactly that and not the rest of the REST API (projects, Autopilot, social
accounts...).

``openshorts`` is the only scope, and the one every MCP client asks for (it is
the single entry of ``scopes_supported``). It covers what the MCP tools do,
which call back into this API in-process with the caller's own header, plus
downloading the results. Keys a user creates by hand have no scope and keep
the whole API, as before.
